The security measures I use are 2FA authentication, strong password. The thing I need to improve is when I see some phishing attempts and suspicious links, normally I wouldn't click into it. But once I did have a delivery in process, and there is a phishing email from
AU post, I click into it and input my bank account. I didn't notice it is a phishing email until I receive a message saying my bank account is binding to apple pay, which I noticed I did the wrong thing. So I need to improve on this and don't click on anything unknown. 

First thing come to my mind is use password manager, which can generate and store passwork for you. 
develop a good hobby on easy things like lock your screen when leaving, verify links before you click on or type your informaiton.

Use password manager, I use apple password manager for my apple device and google password manager for my PC.
Enable 2FA authentication, usually password with email or SMS validation.
Don't use public wifi with VPN.

First I will change my password and then check if any suspicious activity have been done. 
Then contact the platformâ€™s customer support or security team to report the issue(That is what I have done previous time, lock my card and contact the bank about this).

One new cybersecurity habit
improve my security awareness: think before you click the emails and links
